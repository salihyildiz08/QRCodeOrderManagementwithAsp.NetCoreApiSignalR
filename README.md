In this project, I developed a comprehensive real-time application using ASP.NET Core 6.0, featuring both admin and showcase panels. We effectively utilized the SignalR library to enhance the application's capabilities. The project is a restaurant order management system, where we implemented an API for the backend. This API was consumed on the UI side, leveraging a robust interface for an optimal user experience. Both the admin and UI sections, as well as the order management features, proved to be highly satisfactory.

To facilitate reservation processes, we integrated email notifications for users. With SignalR, we implemented real-time features such as instant notifications, messaging, and shopping cart updates. Our coding practices adhered closely to architectural principles and SOLID guidelines, ensuring clean code throughout the development process.
