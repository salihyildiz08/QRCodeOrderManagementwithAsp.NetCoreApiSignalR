# Restaurant Order Management System

In this project, I developed a comprehensive real-time application using **ASP.NET Core 6.0**, featuring both **admin** and **showcase panels**. We effectively utilized the **SignalR** library to enhance the application's capabilities.

The project is a **restaurant order management system**, where we implemented an **API** for the backend. This API was consumed on the UI side, leveraging a robust interface for an optimal user experience. Both the admin and UI sections, as well as the order management features, proved to be highly satisfactory.

To facilitate reservation processes, we integrated **email notifications** for users. With **SignalR**, we implemented real-time features such as instant notifications, messaging, and shopping cart updates. Our coding practices adhered closely to architectural principles and **SOLID guidelines**, ensuring clean code throughout the development process.

## Features

- **Admin Panel**: Manage orders, reservations, users, and real-time updates.
- **Showcase Panel**: Display restaurant menu, real-time order updates, and offer a seamless user experience.
- **Reservation System**: Allows users to make reservations with real-time email notifications.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Chat and notification system powered by SignalR.
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Live updates of order statuses and relevant analytics.
- **Shopping Basket**: Users can manage their cart in real-time.
- **Instant Notifications**: Instant alerts for actions such as order placement or reservation confirmation.
  
## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 6.0**
- **ASP.NET Core API**
